# fooddon

A new Flutter project.

## Objective of fooddon
The objective of the FoodDon project is to develop a mobile application that simplifies the process of donating excess food from households to individuals or organizations in need. The platform aims to promote food sharing and community solidarity by providing users with a convenient way to con- tribute to the fight against hunger. Through the app, users can easily list surplus food items prepared at home and connect with charitable organizations for donation. By leveraging technology to facili- tate food donation, FoodDon seeks to alleviate hunger, reduce food waste, and contribute to building a more food-secure and compassionate society.
